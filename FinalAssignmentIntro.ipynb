I want to pitch to investors who are interested in opening up a Japanese/sushi resturant in New York City and I want to find the most optimal location to start this new business venture. My target audience will be investors who are interested in opening up a Japanese resturant in New York City. I feel that Japanese cuisine is getting more popular in the United States and that New York City would be a great location to start a resturant since there seems to be a lot of Michelin star resturants in that area.

I want to find the best Japanese resturants and to know where they are located to see if there is any possible trend or connection. With the data, I want to find if these sushi resturants are near ports or other places that fresh fish are caught"
